- 📫 How to reach me ... IRC TVVizard, Twitter TVVizard "The W is made with two V's VV"
- So I took a liking in Computers back in 2000 my childhood bestfriend that was my Grandma's Neighbor his dad was an OLD SCHOOL hacker he taught us the fundmentals to linux, We would help him set up the routers around the house or help him clean out all the computers by hand he taught me alot. But is 2004 my Grandmother's house started on fire and she passed away from a house fire fucked me up has a 8 year old kid long story short we moved away from that area and i stopped playing around with networking and computers because my family didnt have the money for me to have a computer or anything like that. My buddy "Alex" his dad had tons of raspberry pi's everywhere tons of computers so he would let me sleep over every other weekend and we continued to learn when the market crashed in 2007 they had to sell their house and they moved away far away so the only way I could keep in contact with "Alex" was if I called him because i didnt get my own computer until 2009 then we would keep incontact on IRC just wanna say thank you alex and his dad they were always real ones to me I love you guys.
